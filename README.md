[![Solanaizer AI Audit](https://github.com/solanaizer/solanaizer-sample-project/actions/workflows/solana-audit.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/solanaizer/solanaizer-sample-project/actions/workflows/solana-audit.yml)

**Solanaizer** is a comprehensive Solana Smart Contrat Auditing Tool using AI 🤖 specifically designed for [Solana](https://solana.com/). Its primary purpose is to thoroughly review and analyze the code governing smart contracts written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) for vulnerabilities. 🐛

- **Objective:** 🎯
  - *Solanaizer* aims to identify potential vulnerabilities, flaws, and security issues within smart contract code.
- **Importance:** ⚠️
  - Given the decentralized nature of blockchain technology, it’s crucial to ensure that smart contracts are secure before deployment. *Solanaizer* provides this critical layer of protection.
- **Auditing Process:** 🕵🏻‍♀️
  - The tool conducts a detailed analysis of the contract’s code, performed by AI 🤖. It looks for security weaknesses, inefficient code, and other potential risks.
- **LLMs (Language Models):** 💭
  - To enhance its auditing capabilities, *Solanaizer* leverages various LLMs, including:
    - [Stability.AI Stable Code 3B](https://stability.ai/news/stable-code-2024-llm-code-completion-release)
    - [GPT-4](https://openai.com/gpt-4)
    - [Claude3 Opus](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-family)

By using **Solanaizer**, developers and users have an extra level of confidence about their smart contracts being free from critical bugs, vulnerabilities, and security flaws, ensuring a safer and more reliable **Solana** ecosystem.
